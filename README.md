a really cool vinyl emulator with digital tech

## Idea

Discs are made out of CH32V003 mcu, BY25Q32 flash, acts as a storage for audio file. Powered through pogo pins when placed in the player.

The player is powered with a RP2040 mcu, PTC PT8211-S DAC, and PAM8403 amplifier. USB powered, maybe battery powered in the future.

Maybe add a spinning motor in the future for extra effect.
